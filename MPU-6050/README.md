## MPU-6050 chip
The MPU-6050 chip measures three functions; acceleration, rotation and temperature.

Rotational axis of MPU-6050 is shown below:

### Acceleration accelerometer
The accelerator on the MPU-6050 chip is MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) accelerometer which measures *linear* acceleration.

### Rotation gyroscope
A MEMS gyroscope is used to measure angular rotation by employing The Coriolis Effect.
